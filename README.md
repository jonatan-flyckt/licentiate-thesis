## Overview

This thesis investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to address challenges in software-intensive product and service development (SIPS). We focus on industrial applications, both through applied machine learning and empirical software engineering. First, we investigate a specific use-case with ditch detection on digital terrain data using a feature engineering approach with Random Forests. Following that, we shift the focus to a broader perspective, presenting a multiple case study of make-to-order manufacturing companies, which investigates AI challenges both from feasibility and usefulness perspectives. Demand forecasting emerges as the most important AI task with many open challenges.

Building on the findings in the case study, a position paper argues for demand forecasting for make-to-order manufacturing companies as a key research direction. This paper also presents a pilot experiment using forecasted demands to improve decision making in a purchasing decision support system. The final paper addresses technical challenges related to intermittent demand forecasting with global deep learning models, where both the timing and magnitude of demands are of importance. We also propose a novel metric which can evaluate such forecasts fairly across heterogeneous collections of time-series. Future work will address challenges such as constructing appropriate subsets for semi-global model training, incorporating exogenous variables, and quantifying prediction uncertainty. Another key direction is evaluating the performance of forecasts in real-world decision support and automated decision-making systems within make-to-order manufacturing.
